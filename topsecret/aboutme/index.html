          <p>Hi, my name is...Slim Shady. No, really, my name is Slim Shady. Just kidding, my name is Mark Zaydman (for those of you that don't know me) and I live in a small town near the massive city of San Fransisco. I am currently 13 years old and I just finished 7th grade in middle school. I have remodeled this website in an attempt that perhaps some search engine will recognize it. I am trying to promote my new Javascript Program, Snake , which you can download elsewhere on this site. It is a decent Snake game. If you have any comments about this website, the elements on it, or the my Snake game which I am trying to promote, please contact me. My E-Mail address is at the bottom of this page.</p>
